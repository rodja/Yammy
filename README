This shell script aims to be a easy-non-feature-rich but
fulfilling-all-you-needs distributed renderer for Maya.

Installation:

1. Edit the example-yammy.conf at your needs and copy it to
   ~/.yammy.conf

2. maybe you want to use a yammyClient file to tell the scrip
   which hosts should be used for rendering

3. run the yammy script (./yammy)
