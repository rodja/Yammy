This shell script aims to be a easy-non-feature-rich but
fulfilling-all-you-needs distributed renderer for Maya.

It was used to render all frames of the short animation movie
"Grandma's Attic" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOrewlEsk9c).
We had ten floating Maya licenses at University. The script
takes care of multi-core setup and is controlled via console.
The render workstations must run Linux or OSX and provide
ssh access.

Installation:

1. Edit the example-yammy.conf at your needs and copy it to
   ~/.yammy.conf
2. maybe you want to use a yammyClient file to tell the script
   which hosts should be used for rendering
3. run the yammy script (./yammy)
